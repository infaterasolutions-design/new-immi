  <p class="text-xl text-slate-900 font-medium mb-8">USCIS has officially announced the FY 2025 H-1B cap registration dates, marking the beginning of a high-stakes season for thousands of employers and beneficiaries seeking specialty occupation visas.</p>
  <p>The electronic registration period will open on <strong>March 1, 2025</strong>, at 12:00 PM Eastern Time and will close on <strong>March 18, 2025</strong>. This 18-day window is consistent with prior years but comes with significant procedural changes designed to curb abuse of the lottery system.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">Key Changes for FY 2025</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Under the new beneficiary-centric model, USCIS will select unique beneficiaries rather than individual registrations. If a beneficiary is selected, any eligible registrations submitted by different employers for that beneficiary will be approved for filing.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">What Employers Need to Know</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Employers must ensure their organizational accounts are up to date and that all legal representatives are properly linked. The $10 registration fee per beneficiary remains unchanged, but USCIS has hinted at potential fee adjustments in future cycles.</p>
  <p>Immigration attorneys recommend reviewing all pending labor condition applications (LCAs) and ensuring wage level compliance before the registration window opens. Any discrepancies could lead to denial or requests for evidence (RFEs) during the petition phase.</p>
  <p class="mt-6">For beneficiaries currently in valid H-1B status, the cap-exempt extension process remains available. Those changing employers should consult with counsel about the transfer timeline relative to the cap season.</p>

  <p class="text-xl text-slate-900 font-medium mb-8">As the H-1B visa cap continues to leave thousands of highly skilled workers without options, major technology hubs across the United States are pushing for a significant expansion of the EB-1 extraordinary ability visa category.</p>
  <p>Leaders from Silicon Valley, Austin, Boston, and Seattle have jointly submitted a policy proposal to Congress advocating for tripling the annual allotment of EB-1 visas. The proposal argues that the current cap fails to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving AI and semiconductor industries.</p>
  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 my-8 italic text-slate-800">"We are in a global talent war. Every EB-1 visa we don't issue is a world-class researcher who ends up building technology for a competitor nation." — Sarah Chen, TechBridge Alliance</blockquote>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">The Current EB-1 Landscape</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">The EB-1 category currently accounts for approximately 28.6% of the total employment-based green card allotment. Unlike the H-1B, it does not require a labor certification, making it attractive for self-petitioning researchers and artists.</p>
  <div class="my-10 p-8 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-100">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-primary mb-4 flex items-center gap-2"><span class="material-symbols-outlined pb-1">trending_up</span> EB-1 by the Numbers</h3>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-600 list-disc pl-5">
      <li><strong>Annual EB-1 Allotment:</strong> ~40,040 visas across three subcategories.</li>
      <li><strong>EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability):</strong> No employer sponsorship required.</li>
      <li><strong>EB-1B (Outstanding Researchers):</strong> Requires university or research institution sponsorship.</li>
      <li><strong>EB-1C (Multinational Managers):</strong> For intracompany transferees in executive roles.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>The proposal has received bipartisan interest, though immigration hawks have voiced concerns about potential fraud. Tech industry groups counter that the EB-1's rigorous evidentiary standards already provide sufficient safeguards.</p>
  <p class="mt-6">If enacted, the expansion would take effect in fiscal year 2026, providing immediate relief to thousands of applicants currently facing multi-year backlogs in the EB-2 and EB-3 categories.</p>

const content_h1b_rfe = `
  <p class="text-xl text-slate-900 font-medium mb-8">Receiving a Request for Evidence (RFE) on your H-1B petition can be stressful, but with the right strategy, most RFEs can be resolved favorably. This guide walks you through the process step by step.</p>
  <p>An RFE is not a denial—it's USCIS asking for additional documentation to support your petition. Common reasons include insufficient evidence of specialty occupation, wage level concerns, or questions about the employer-employee relationship.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">Step 1: Analyze the RFE Notice Carefully</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Read every line of the RFE notice. USCIS will specify exactly what additional evidence they need. Most RFEs fall into one of these categories:</p>
  <div class="my-10 p-8 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-100">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-primary mb-4 flex items-center gap-2"><span class="material-symbols-outlined pb-1">checklist</span> Common RFE Categories</h3>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-600 list-disc pl-5">
      <li><strong>Specialty Occupation:</strong> Proving the role requires a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a specific field.</li>
      <li><strong>Beneficiary Qualifications:</strong> Demonstrating the worker has the required education and experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Employer-Employee Relationship:</strong> Showing the petitioner has the right to control the work.</li>
      <li><strong>Wage Level:</strong> Justifying that the offered wage meets prevailing wage requirements.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">Step 2: Gather Supporting Documentation</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Work closely with your immigration attorney to compile comprehensive evidence. Expert opinion letters from professors in the field can be particularly persuasive for specialty occupation RFEs.</p>
  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 my-8 italic text-slate-800">"The strongest RFE responses don't just answer the question—they overwhelm the adjudicator with evidence that makes approval the only reasonable conclusion."</blockquote>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">Step 3: Submit Before the Deadline</h2>
  <p>You typically have 84 calendar days (12 weeks) to respond. Never wait until the last minute. Submit your response via trackable mail and keep copies of everything. Late responses are treated as abandonments.</p>

  <p class="text-xl text-slate-900 font-medium mb-8">In a landmark 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled on the scope of asylum protections available to individuals simultaneously pursuing green card applications through family-based immigration channels.</p>
  <p>The ruling in <em>Garcia v. Mayorkas</em> addresses whether asylum seekers who have pending I-130 family petitions can maintain both applications concurrently, or whether they must elect one pathway. The Court sided with broader protections, affirming that dual-track processing is constitutionally permissible.</p>
  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 my-8 italic text-slate-800">"The statutory framework does not require an applicant to choose between seeking humanitarian protection and pursuing family unity. Both interests are fundamental to our immigration system." — Justice Elena Kagan, majority opinion</blockquote>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">1. How Did You Meet?</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Officers want a natural, detailed story. Include specifics: the date, location, who introduced you, what you were both doing at the time. Vague answers raise red flags.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">2. When Did You Start Dating?</h2>

const content_uscis_fees = `
  <p class="text-xl text-slate-900 font-medium mb-8">In a surprising reversal, USCIS has officially rejected a proposed fee increase for family-based immigration petitions following intense public commentary and advocacy from immigration rights organizations.</p>
  <p>The proposed rule, which would have raised I-130 petition fees by 35% and naturalization application fees by 20%, drew over 120,000 public comments during the notice-and-comment period—with the vast majority opposing the increases.</p>

  <p>The EB-2 India priority date has retrogressed from <strong>January 1, 2012</strong> to <strong>June 1, 2009</strong>—a staggering backward movement of approximately 2.5 years in a single bulletin cycle. This means thousands of applicants who were current last month are no longer eligible to file their I-485 applications.</p>

  <p>Immigration attorneys are advising affected clients to explore EB-1 self-petition options, EB-3 downgrade strategies, and National Interest Waiver (NIW) filings as potential alternatives. The retrogression also highlights the urgent need for legislative reform to eliminate per-country caps.</p>

  <p class="text-xl text-slate-900 font-medium mb-8">Is the newly expanded premium processing service worth its multi-thousand dollar price tag? We break down the costs, benefits, and strategic considerations for every major petition category now eligible for expedited adjudication.</p>
  <p>USCIS has significantly expanded premium processing availability in 2024, extending the service to I-140 EB-1C and EB-2 NIW petitions, certain I-539 change of status applications, and I-765 employment authorization documents for specific categories.</p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">Current Premium Processing Fees</h2>
  <div class="my-10 p-8 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-100">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-primary mb-4 flex items-center gap-2"><span class="material-symbols-outlined pb-1">speed</span> Fee Structure by Form Type</h3>
    <ul class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-600 list-disc pl-5">
      <li><strong>I-129 (H-1B, L-1, O-1, etc.):</strong> $2,805 – 15 business day processing.</li>
      <li><strong>I-140 (EB-1, EB-2, EB-3):</strong> $2,805 – 45 calendar day processing.</li>
      <li><strong>I-539 (Change of Status):</strong> $1,750 – 30 business day processing.</li>
      <li><strong>I-765 (EAD):</strong> $1,500 – 30 business day processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4 font-['Plus_Jakarta_Sans']">When It's Worth It</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Premium processing makes strategic sense when: you're facing an expiring status deadline, you need work authorization to start a new position, or uncertainty is costing you business opportunities. For I-140 petitions, premium processing also provides faster approval for H-1B extensions beyond the 6-year limit.</p>
  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 my-8 italic text-slate-800">"Premium processing isn't just about speed—it's about certainty. In immigration, knowing your answer in 15 days versus 15 months can be worth far more than the filing fee."</blockquote>
  <p>However, premium processing does not guarantee approval. If USCIS issues an RFE during premium processing, the 15-day clock resets once you respond. For straightforward petitions with strong evidence, the investment usually pays for itself in reduced anxiety and faster authorization.</p>
